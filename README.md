# Bank_System
This is the repository for my second Banking System project, which should reinforce my knowledge of OOP.

Day 1: Introduction to OOP, solving test problems, + the birth of the Banking System idea, + the program skeleton.

Day 2: Implemented new client registration with the following input:
First name, Last name, Date of birth, Phone number, Email, Password.
Field validation added:
Client data is saved to a JSON file (Bank.json).
Login via email and password implemented.

Day 03 After big rest, i continue my journey
Today i finally did system of validation, and Tomorrow i will continue work with OOP

Day 04 Today I worked on the "Accounts" class, adding account verification, account replenishment, and account withdrawal functions, all in different currencies.
I'm continuing to improve validation and starting work on linking clients and their accounts.

Day 05 I worked on the Bank class and the main logic of the program, now it works.
