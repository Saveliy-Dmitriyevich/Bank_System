# Bank_System
This is the repository for my second Banking System project, which should reinforce my knowledge of OOP.

Day 1: Introduction to OOP, solving test problems, + the birth of the Banking System idea, + the program skeleton.

Day 2: Implemented new client registration with the following input:
First name, Last name, Date of birth, Phone number, Email, Password.
Field validation added:
Client data is saved to a JSON file (Bank.json).
Login via email and password implemented.

Day 03 After big rest, i continue my journey
Today i finally did system of validation, and Tomorrow i will continue work with OOP
